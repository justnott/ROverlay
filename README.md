# --[INSTRUCTIONS]--

Quick Setup:
1. Enable HTTP Requests and Studio Access to API Services

2. In the command bar at the bottom, type

`require(game.Workspace.ROverlay.Setup):Setup()`

and click Enter!

DO NOT close ROBLOX Studio while this process is running. This could take a minute or longer to install
due to the amount of assets that need to be created and moved.
